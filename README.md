# Nodeinst-apt
This repository was made for new developers using a linux system with the **apt package manager**.

## How to use?
- Open a terminal.

- If you **do not** have git installed, execute this command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```
- After, clone this repository to the desired download location:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leanderlombardi/nodeinst-apt.git && \
cd nodeinst-apt
```
- Now, you should be in a folder named `nodeinst-apt`.
- To now install Node.JS and npm, execute the file by doing:
```bash
chmod +x ./nodeinst.sh && \
./nodeinst.sh
```
- Now you should be prompted your password. Type it in and press enter.
- Wait until it says `"Successfully installed the latest stable Node.JS and NPM version"`.
- NodeJS and NPM should now both be installed.
